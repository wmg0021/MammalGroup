##########  Define variables and make directories
## Replace the numbers in the brackets with Your specific information
  ## make variable for your ASC ID so the directories are automatically made in YOUR directory
MyID=aubtss          ## Example: MyID=aubtss

WD=/scratch/$MyID/Rat          ## Example:/scratch/$MyID/PracticeRNAseq  
DD=$WD/RawData
RDQ=RawDataQuality
adapters=AdaptersToTrim_All.fa  ## This is a fasta file that has a list of adapters commonly used in NGS sequencing. 
				## In the future, for your data, you will likely need to edit this for other projects based on how your libraries 
				## were made to search for the correct adapters for your project
CD=$WD/CleanData            				## Example:/scratch/$MyID/PracticeRNAseq/CleanData   #   *** This is where the cleaned paired files are located from the last script
PCQ=PostCleanQuality

##  make the directories in SCRATCH for holding the raw data 
## -p tells it to make any upper level directories that are not there.
mkdir -p ${WD}
mkdir -p ${DD}

## make the directories to hold the Cleaned Data files, and the directory to hold the results for assessing quality of the cleaned data.
mkdir ${CD}
mkdir ${WD}/${PCQ}


## Move to Raw Data Directory
cd ${DD}

### Make list of file names to Trim
        ## this line is a set of piped (|) commands
        ## ls means make a list, 
        ## grep means grab all the file names that end in ".fastq", 
        ## cut that name into elements every where you see "_" and keep the first element (-f 1)
        ## sort the list and keep only the unique names and put it into a file named "list"
ls | grep ".fastq" |cut -d "_" -f 1 | sort | uniq > list

### Copy over the list of Sequencing Adapters that we want Trimmomatic to look for (along with its default adapters)
        ## CHECK: You may need to edit this path for the file that is in the class_shared directory from your account.
cp /home/${MyID}/class_shared/AdaptersToTrim_All.fa . 

### Run a while loop to process through the names in the list and Trim them with the Trimmomatic Code
while read i
do

        ### Run Trimmomatic in paired end (PE) mode with 6 threads using phred 33 quality score format.
